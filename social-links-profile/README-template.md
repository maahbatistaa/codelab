## Overview

### O desafio

Os usu√°rios devem poder:

- Veja os estados do mouse e foco para todos os elementos interativos na p√°gina

### screenShot

! [] (./ screenShot.jpg)

Adicione uma captura de tela da sua solu√ß√£o.A maneira mais f√°cil de fazer isso √© usar o Firefox para ver seu projeto, clique com o bot√£o direito do mouse na p√°gina e selecione "Take uma captura de tela".Voc√™ pode escolher uma captura de tela de altura total ou uma cortada com base em quanto tempo a p√°gina dura.Se for muito longo, pode ser melhor cort√° -lo.

Como alternativa, voc√™ pode usar uma ferramenta como [FireShot] (https://getfireshot.com/) para tirar a captura de tela.O FireShot tem uma op√ß√£o gratuita, ent√£o voc√™ n√£o precisa compr√° -lo.

Em seguida, corte/otimize/edite sua imagem como quiser, adicione -a ao seu projeto e atualize o caminho do arquivo na imagem acima.

** NOTA: Exclua esta nota e os par√°grafos acima quando voc√™ adiciona sua captura de tela.Se voc√™ preferir n√£o adicionar uma captura de tela, fique √† vontade para remover toda essa se√ß√£o. **
